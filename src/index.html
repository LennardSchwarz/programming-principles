            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-slate-800">
                <li>Write code for others. Don't be clever.</li>
                <li>Writing new features is fun. Maintaining them is the work.</li>
                <li>Solve the problem behind the feature.</li>
                <li>For each desired change, make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change.</li>
                <li>Be fearless. Never be scared of looking into or touching code.</li>
                <li>Always strive towards high quality and know when tradeoffs need to be made.</li>
                <li>I have a bad memory and I build systems with that in mind.</li>
                <li>The choice of programming language is secondary to the development.</li>
                <li>Robustness, simplicity and maintainability are most important and dependent on each other.</li>
                <li>I know my tools very well, and believe that deep knowledge of my tools will pay off.</li>
                <li>Knowledge further down in the stack gives me more leverage higher up.</li>
                <li>I try to work it out on my own, before I ask other people.</li>
                <li>Asking for help is good, helping others is good.</li>
                <li>If you can't explain something to others, you probably don't understand it properly yourself.</li>
                <li>It's a bad sign if I can't delete my code and rewrite it quickly.</li>
                <li>When something only has upsides, or only downsides, you probably haven't looked at enough trade-offs, or you're playing a different game.</li>
                <li>About every 10 years, there seems to be a reemergence of the ideas 30-40 years before but in a different context - try the other side. You'll see why the dogma doesn't always apply.</li>
                <li>If you can do it on a single machine, do it on a single machine.</li>
                <li>I want to build robust systems that run for years on their own, that are easy to modify, in which bugs are easily spotted and removed.</li>
                <li>Taking on technical debt can be a conscious decision to go faster.</li>
                <li>
                    Technical debt can be classified into three main types. Minimize having lots of stuff in #1 and try to focus on #2. Ignore #3.
