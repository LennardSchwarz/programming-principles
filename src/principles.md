### My Programming Principles

A loosely ordered list of programming principles that I strive to live by.

- Write code for others. Don't be clever.
- Writing new features is fun. Maintaining them is the work.
- Solve the problem behind the feature.
- For each desired change, make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change
- Be fearless. Never be scared of looking into or touching code.
- Always strive towards high quality and know when tradeoffs need to be made.
- I have a bad memory and I build systems with that in mind.
- The choice of programming language is secondary to the development.
- Robustness, simplicity and maintainability are most important and dependent on each other.
- I know my tools very well, and believe that deep knowledge of my tools will pay off.
- Knowledge further down in the stack gives me more leverage higher up.
- I try to work it out on my own, before I ask other people.
- Asking for help is good, helping others is good.
- If you can't explain something to others, you probably don't understand it properly yourself.
- It's a bad sign if I can't delete my code and rewrite it quickly.
- When something only has upsides, or only downsides, you probably haven't looked at enough trade-offs, or you're playing a different game.
- About every 10 years, there seems to be a reemergence of the ideas 30-40 years before but in a different context - try the other side. You'll see why the dogma doesn't always apply.
- If you can do it on a single machine, do it on a singe machine.
- I want to build robust systems that run for years on their own, that are easy to modify, in which bugs are easily spotted and removed.
- Taking on technical debt can be a conscious decision to go faster.
- Technical debt can be classified into three main types. Minimize having lots of stuff in #1 and try to focus on #2. Ignore #3.
    1. things that are preventing you from doing stuff now
    2. things that will prevent you from doing stuff later
    3. things that might prevent you from doing stuff later
